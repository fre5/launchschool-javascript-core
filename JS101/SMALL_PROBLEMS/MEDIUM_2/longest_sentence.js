/*
Problem :
- Write a program that prints the longest sentence based on the number of words.

Examples / Test cases :
console.log(longestSentence(longText));
// Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
//
// The longest sentence has 30 words.

longestSentence(longerText);
// It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
//
// The longest sentence has 86 words.

longestSentence("Where do you think you're going? What's up, Doc?");
// Where do you think you're going?
//
// The longest sentence has 6 words.

longestSentence("To be or not to be! Is that the question?");
// To be or not to be!
//
// The longest sentence has 6 words.

Data structure :
- Input : string
- Output : string of the longest sentence and the words count
Rules:
- The sentence separators are = '!', '?', and '.'
- ',',"'" and '--' are included, everything separated by a space is counted as a word

Algorithm :
- The input string will have to be split into an array of individual words separated by a single whitespace
- Each words then needs to be iterated to find out if the last character of each word is a SPECIAL_CHARACTER
- Declare and initialize a local array variable named longestSentence and assign it to the initial value of [] (empty array), this will be used to get the longest sentence
- Declare and initialize a local array variable named currentSentence and assign it to the initial value of [] (empty array), this will be used to store elements of the current sentence
- Loop the array and increment the input array and push every word to the currentSentence array variable until a word with the SPECIAL_CHARACTER appears 
- If currentSentence.length is bigger than longerSentence.length assign the value of currentSentence to longestSentence
- Join longestSentence back into a string and log longestSentence and its length on the console

Code:*/
function longestSentence(string) {
  return string.split(/([.?!]+)/)
}

  'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this ' +

  'great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so ' +
  'conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great ' +
  'battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that ' +

  'struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add ' +
  'or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say ' +
  'here but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the ' +
  'living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which ' +
  'they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather ' +
  'for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- ' +
  'that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that ' +
  'cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that ' +
